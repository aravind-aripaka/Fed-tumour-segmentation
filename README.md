# Fed-tumour-segmentation

This project involves developing a system where multiple "virtual" hospitals collaboratively train a deep learning model, such as a U-Net 16, for segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans. Publicly available datasets like BraTS 11 or TCIA 11 can be partitioned to simulate data from different institutions. The futuristic angle is its direct contribution to building robust, privacy-preserving AI tools for clinical decision support in oncology, enabling the use of larger and more diverse datasets for training highly accurate medical AI models without compromising patient confidentiality.14 This aligns with the growing need for collaborative research in healthcare while adhering to strict data privacy regulations.
